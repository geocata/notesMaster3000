# notesMaster3000  
  
  A simple app for taking notes.  
  You can select which colors to be used for the note's background and text.  
  You can save your data/progress in the cloud or locally. The cloud option will store your data in a public json repository so don't use this feature if you want to save private data (uncheck the checkbox placed at the top of the page). You can save your progress locally, on your computer instead and load it when you come back.
